## Abstract

The Well-Engineered Framework helps organizations understand benefits and limitations of different architectural approaches. The framework is designed to help organizations build adaptive, resilient, high-performing and secure infrastructure for their applications.

Organizations can utilize the Well-Engineered Framework to consistently measure and identify areas for improvement. The framework documents a set of principles, strategies, case studies and foundational questions that organizations can use to undestand if a specific architecture aligns with their business goals.

The Well-Engineered Framework is designed to be technology agnostic and can be applied to any technology stack. The framework is designed to be used by organizations of all sizes, from startups to large enterprises. The framework is intended to be used by solution architects, infrastructure specialists, security engineers, developers, support engineers, and others involved in technology decision-making.

The Well-Engineered Framework defines 12 principles that organizations can use to evaluate their architecture.

1. Mutable Specification
2. Quality Assessment
3. Adaptive by Design
4. Multitenancy
5. Monitoring and Reporting
6. Operational Resilience
7. Automation Oriented
8. Zero-Day Security
9. Feedback Mechanism
10. Cost Allocation
